### Ahoy! <br />
I'm Julien and I'm a 7+ yrs iOS engineer.
I'm interested in simple user interface, nice and clean code, but all deep things "under the hood" too, such as CI/CD, xcoproj management ... and much more !<br /><br />

For the past few years i'm convince my job can be useful for medical applications, so i joined Sweepin (FR) and more recently, the Maincare (FR) family !<br /><br /><br />


Gimme a poke, i'll be happy to talk about iOS development (or anything else).

See ya ðŸ¤Ÿ
